## Version 1.0  

- While personally tested, make sure to backup your config file often to avoid customisation loss.
- Tested with Maya 2025 and 2026
- **Minor Bug** - When closing or opening a panel, the selection might change to the panel item on top. Please take note of which panel you are editing before making any changes.
